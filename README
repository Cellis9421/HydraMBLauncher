# Hydra Multibox Manager

## About

This script will launch multiple game clients using the hydra launcher. It will also monitor the game clients and relaunch any crashed clients.
This script is useful for running multiple accounts on a single computer (multiboxing).
It is recommended to use a seperate RL, Hydra, and proxy for each account.

## Prerequisites:

1. Java 8 or higher (installed as PATH variable)
2. Runelite (https://runelite.net/)
3. Hydra launcher (Discord)
4. Accounts.txt file with accounts in the format of email|runelite_profile|hydra_profile|proxy:port:username:password

## Accounts.txt example:

One row per account

```
email|runelite_profile|hydra_profile|proxy:port:username:password
email|runelite_profile|hydra_profile|proxy:port:username:password
email|runelite_profile|hydra_profile|proxy:port:username:password
```
